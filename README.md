## PROJECT IS DEPREACTED

#gmusic.api: an unofficial Java API for Google Play Music

This project needs help! I currently have way to little time to maintain this my self so ANY help would be appreciated!

The project is not supported nor endorsed by Google. 

**Respect Google in your use of the API**. Use common sense (protocol compliance, reasonable load, etc) and don't ruin the fun for everyone else.

This project is a port of [(Simon Weber's great work)](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API) of a port [(Taylor Finnell's port to .NET)](https://github.com/Byteopia/GoogleMusicAPI.NET) written in Java.

**Feature Overview:**

* Getting library information:
    * all song metadata
    * all user playlist titles and ids
    * songs from a specific playlist

* Song downloading

The api currently only implement read methods (get and retrieval) but more methods could be implemented in time either by me or you:)

This project is dual licensed under GNU GPL, Version 3 and MIT.
